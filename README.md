Project goal:

Foundation of Rpg is a project with the goal of replicating the basic systems of the 'Rpg Divinity Original Sin 2' and other games by Larian Studio.
Examples of systems I have replicated:
- Character controls
- Character portraits
- Point-and-click movement
- Click-to-interact functionality
- Switching characters using their portraits
- Separating the party into two groups
- Making other party members follow the currently controlled character
